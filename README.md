# Lemmings.py
Lemmings.ts converted to python.

## Reason
This python game was made for AI but that is for the future, for now I am still converting and maybe later I will have a version with AI integrated into it. We will have to wait as I will update this README.md when I am finished as this will just be for fun.

## How To Install
ubuntu linux installation:

    git clone https://github.com/ethicalhacker7192/Lemmings.py
    cd Lemmings.py
    python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

note:
this is assuming you have python3 installed and you are running ubuntu linux. I will start working on making this project work on many different linux distrobutions so be patient if your distrobution is not compatible. If python3 is not installed run the code below to install python3 in ubuntu linux:

    sudo apt install python3

windows installation:

first save this project as a zip and then unzip it. then run the following commands in your command prompt:

    cd [path to project]
    py -m pip install -r requirements.txt

note: this is assuming you have the latest python release downloaded if not go to the official website <a href="https://python.org/downloads">(python.org)</a> and download the latest version.
    
    
## How To Run

## Issues
If you have any issues do not be shy to post your issues into the issues page as I will try to fix/resolve the issues.

## DISCLAIMER: 
I am still working on making this compatible with mac so all those with their macbooks be patient as I get it taylored for macbooks as well!
I am not promising anything including the development of AI, I am simply stating my intentions for the future if the time ever comes. For now do not get your hopes up.
I did not create this software and I give all credit to <a href="https://github.com/tomsoftware">tomsoftware</a>, without these people, this project would not exist: 

    DMA for the original game
    Volker Oth, ccexplore and Mindless for their work on reverse engineering the Lemmings Level and Grafic Formats
    DosBox for there OPL emulator
